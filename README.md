# ensemble-stacking-methods-machine-learning
The goal of this repository is to be the source of the latest ensemble stacking methods available via github, kaggle competitions and research papers. The stacking methods will be accompanied with working examples and comparison vs non-stacked models to show a comparison of performance of the prediction tasks.
